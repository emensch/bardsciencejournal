      | The Bard Science Journal is a student run and produced online magazine. Our goal is to provide all students at
      | Bard a platform to explore the complicated relationship between scientific thinking and the world around them. In
      | addition, we hope to bring the experience of studying science to a broader audience. We are proud of the
      | scientific work and engagement that occurs within the Bard community and hope to provide an avenue for these
      | stories to reach others. As technological and scientific thinking are becoming more inescapable in our everyday
      | culture, politics, and health, engaging with these topics at the interdisciplinary level is increasingly valuable.
      | The publication is left intentionally fluid in order to accommodate Bard studentsâ€™ interest for publication and
      | writing experience.
